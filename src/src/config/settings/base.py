"""
Base settings entrypoint.

Assembles all component fragments via wildcard imports so that environment
files (local.py, production.py, test.py) can simply ``from .base import *`` and then
apply their own overrides.

Import order matters: environment first (BASE_DIR), then django (uses
BASE_DIR), then the rest which are order-independent. The ``I001`` suppression
below keeps this intentional order (Ruff would otherwise sort the imports
alphabetically, which would re-introduce the subtle ordering bug).
