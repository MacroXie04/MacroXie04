"""Per-Django-app admin access predicate.

The project replaced per-user Django ``user_permissions`` with coarse per-app access:
an admin member carries a list of app labels (``Member.admin_apps``) and may
view/add/change/delete every model in any app on that list. ``is_superuser`` (the
Root Admin account) bypasses the list entirely.

This helper is the single source of truth for that decision and is enforced at every
gate (the Django admin base class, the shared ``safe_orm`` layer / AI action engine,
and the ``/admin-api/`` CLI). It deliberately *duck-types* the user object — it only
reads attributes and never imports ``Member`` — so ``apps.core`` keeps no import
dependency on ``apps.authn``.
