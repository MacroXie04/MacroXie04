"""
Service layer for passwordless phone authentication (signup + login).

A caller proves ownership of a phone number via the SMS OTP in
``services/sms/sns_verify.py`` (cache-keyed, member-independent, one-time). Once
the code is approved, :func:`resolve_or_create_member_by_phone` either logs in
the member that owns the number or creates a brand-new phone-only account.

This mirrors the unified passwordless *email* flow but the OTP is consumed in the
view before this runs, so the member is created **active in one shot** (there is
no "pending phone member" state to activate later).
