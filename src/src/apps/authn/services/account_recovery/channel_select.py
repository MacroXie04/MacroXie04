"""Verification-channel selection for password create/change flows.

A member may verify a password operation through a verified email or, when no
verified email exists, a verified phone via SMS. The selection order is:

  1. an explicitly requested email that is an eligible (verified) auth email,
  2. the verified primary email,
  3. any verified contact email,
  4. the oldest verified phone (SMS),

otherwise :class:`NoRecoveryChannelError` is raised.
