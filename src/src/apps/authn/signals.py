"""
Signal handlers that fire member-to-Google-Sheet sync on member-related writes.

Wires `post_save` and `post_delete` on Member, ContactEmail, and ContactPhone
to `schedule_member_sync()`, deferred via `transaction.on_commit` so the sheet
sees only committed state.

`schedule_member_sync()` is itself a no-op when the config is disabled, so
these receivers are safe to leave registered unconditionally.
